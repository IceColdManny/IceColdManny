- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Manny, i'm a student currently
- I'm Mexican
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, i want to create a big enterprise focused on creating useful and original software in the future, i'm focusing on Android apps, Java and HTML at the moment.
- ðŸ“š i have learned a bit of these languages: C++, Java and HTML, i'm currently learning: PHP with SQL, and Android Studio with Java, i've made an Android app for a school project but nothing so great, definitely i'm not a professional... yet.
- i can be found only here on GitHub, at least for now.
- i'm new on GitHub right now
